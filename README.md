Developed the **largest**, and **first real-field image (India)** plant disease dataset comprising **3,500** images of **Citrus**.

**Introduction**

1. Plant diseases are a major cause of yield reduction in agriculture, leading to significant economic losses. Citrus crops, which constitute a primary global source of essential nutrients such as vitamin C, are particularly affected, as citrus diseases severely degrade both fruit quality and overall production.

2. Computer vision and image processing techniques have been extensively employed for the automated detection and classification of plant diseases, offering effective and scalable solutions for precision agriculture.

3. The proposed dataset comprises images of both healthy and diseased citrus fruits and leaves, intended to support research on disease prevention and diagnosis using advanced computer vision–based approaches. The dataset includes samples affected by Greening, Anthracnose, Black Spot, Kenkar, Nutrient Deficiency, and Mold diseases.

4. The dataset contains a total of **3,500** images encompassing both citrus fruits and leaves, representing healthy and diseased conditions. Each image has a spatial resolution of 256 × 256 pixels with a resolution of 72 dpi.

5. All images were acquired in the Durgapura region, a tropical agricultural zone in Jaipur, Rajasthan, under the supervision of Dr. Pratibha Singh, Junior Soil Scientist, affiliated with the, Rajasthan Agriculture Research Institute (RARI), Jaipur.

5. Manual annotation of all images was performed by the Research scholars: Sagar Mal Mitharwal and Anand Kumar Jain, under the supervision of domain expert Dr. Pratibha Singh to ensure accurate class labeling. The dataset includes 150 fruit images categorized into Black Spot, Canker, Greening, Scab, and healthy classes, and 609 leaf images categorized into Black Spot, Canker, Greening, Melanose, and healthy classes.
